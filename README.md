# Files & Folders on Taskbar
A simple tool for pinning files and folders to the taskbar. It looks like this:

This tool can create a shortcut to a file or folder that can be pinned to your taskbar. 

It can also create a separator shortcut for further organising the shortcuts on your taskbar.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How it works?
Before creating the shortcut, you'll be asked to pick the file/folder you want to pin to the taskbar. 

Then, you will be asked to choose an icon for the shortcut. If you want to pin a folder, in the main window of the program you will have an option to use the folder's icon if it has a custom one.

After choosing the icon, a File Explorer window will open with the folder where the shortcut has been saved. Now you'll need to drag the shortcut to your taskbar. I will have to find a way to pin the shortcut directly to the taskbar, but right now it seems complicated...

## üé® Separator styles
This app supports the following separator styles:

| Style | Info |
|:------|:-----|
| Vertical | A vertical line. Suitable for horizontal taskbars.
| Horizontal | A horizontal line. Suitable for vertical taskbars.
| Transparent | A completly transparent image.

When creating a separator shortcut, you will be asked about its style in this window:
